# why should I use beep's agentic yield?

If you’ve ever opened ten tabs trying to compare APYs, bridge assets, or chase the next incentive farm, you already know how broken yield management is. Rates move hourly. Incentives disappear mid-transaction. Gas eats half your profit.

Beep was built to fix that.

### [Direct link to heading](https://documentation.justbeep.it/product-overview/agentic-yield/why-should-i-use-beeps-agentic-yield\#what-it-actually-does)    🧠 What It Actually Does

Beep’s Agentic Yield deploys an **ai-agent** that runs on-chain 24/7 — scanning, scoring, and reallocating your capital whenever a better opportunity appears.
No dashboards to refresh. No bridging gymnastics. No human babysitting.

Your agent:

- **Monitors** real-time yield markets across **Sui, BASE, and SOL**

- **Scores** each opportunity based on return, liquidity depth, and risk profile

- **Executes** reallocations instantly when net yield improves

- **Compounds** automatically — gas-aware, risk-adjusted, and transparent


You keep custody of funds the entire time using your keys

### [Direct link to heading](https://documentation.justbeep.it/product-overview/agentic-yield/why-should-i-use-beeps-agentic-yield\#why-its-better)    💸 Why It’s Better

- **No manual chasing** — your agent sees every on-chain opportunity before you do.

- **Zero custody risk** — funds live in your own wallet, not a shared pool.

- **Gas-smart execution** — moves only when net yield > cost.

- **Cross-protocol optimization** — Sui (Scallop, Navi, Bluefin), BASE (Morpho, Moonwell), and SOL (Kamino, MarginFi).

- **Always compounding** — your capital never sits idle.


Beep’s engine basically turns your wallet into an **autonomous DeFi quant**.
