# security

Every yield action happens inside your own smart account, and every move is signed, scoped, and verifiable on-chain. The agent can operate automatically, but it never has custody.

### [Direct link to heading](https://documentation.justbeep.it/product-overview/agentic-yield/security\#access-and-permissions)    Access and Permissions

Authentication always begins with your wallet.
Whether you connect directly or through a smart-account provider, control of assets never leaves your custody.

If you revoke access, the agent stops immediately. There’s no “off switch delay” or centralized fallback.

### [Direct link to heading](https://documentation.justbeep.it/product-overview/agentic-yield/security\#risk-and-protocol-safety)    Risk and Protocol Safety

Beep’s agentic yield engine avoids the usual DeFi roulette.
The agent focuses on **proven, liquid, and audited** protocols

Current integrations: **Bluefin, Navi, SUIlend, Momentum, Kamino, Morpho, Aave, Moonwell, Cetus, Fluid, Kamino.**

Selection factors include liquidity depth, historical uptime, open audits, and active insurance modules.
The agent continuously monitors for risk events and can pause allocations in-flight if something degrades on-chain.

### [Direct link to heading](https://documentation.justbeep.it/product-overview/agentic-yield/security\#full-transparency)    Full Transparency

Every transaction is logged and visible — you can trace each step, check every protocol call, and export history from your dashboard. Withdrawals to USDC are always available, and you can exit a strategy at any time without waiting for an epoch or third-party approval.

In short: Beep automates your yield, but control never leaves your hands.
