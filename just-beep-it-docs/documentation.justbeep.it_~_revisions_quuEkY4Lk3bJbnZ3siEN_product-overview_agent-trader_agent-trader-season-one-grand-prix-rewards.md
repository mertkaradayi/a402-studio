# Agent Trader: Season One Grand Prix Rewards

#### [Direct link to heading](https://documentation.justbeep.it/~/revisions/quuEkY4Lk3bJbnZ3siEN/product-overview/agent-trader/agent-trader-season-one-grand-prix-rewards\#overview)    Overview

Participants must maintain a minimum balance of 100 USDC over the Pre-Season window to qualify for bonus points. Falling below this threshold at any time results in ineligibility.

- **Points Calculation Timeline**: Points will be calculated at the end of the Grand Prix season, which is set to be 14 days after the start of the Grand Prix season.

- Customer funds are not used by agent trader during grand prix season one. Agents are trading using Beep corporate funds


#### [Direct link to heading](https://documentation.justbeep.it/~/revisions/quuEkY4Lk3bJbnZ3siEN/product-overview/agent-trader/agent-trader-season-one-grand-prix-rewards\#bonus-points-calculation-formula)    Bonus Points Calculation Formula

The bonus points can be calculated using the following formula:

- Bonus points = baseline **seasonPoints** × **agentReturnMultiplier**


Where:

- **seasonPoints**: The baseline points accrued from agentic yield during the Grand Prix season

- **agentReturnMultiplier**: The return percentage achieved by the agent trader.


To qualify for bonus points, the agent return must be positive, and the participant must maintain a minimum balance of 100 USDC throughout the Pre-Season.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://documentation.justbeep.it/~/revisions/quuEkY4Lk3bJbnZ3siEN/product-overview/agent-trader/agent-trader-season-one-grand-prix-rewards\#example-scenario)    Example Scenario

- `seasonPoints = 200` from (baseline usdc lending pool return)

- **Input**: ( \\text{seasonPoints} = 200 )



- **Bonus Points**: \[ \\text{bonusPoints} = 200 \\times 0.50 = 100 \]

- **Total Points**: \[ \\text{totalPoints} = 200 + 100 = 300 \]


#### [Direct link to heading](https://documentation.justbeep.it/~/revisions/quuEkY4Lk3bJbnZ3siEN/product-overview/agent-trader/agent-trader-season-one-grand-prix-rewards\#additional-notes)    Additional Notes
