# supported assets

Agentic Yield currently supports **USDC** — the most widely adopted and liquid stablecoin in the Sui ecosystem. Your agent can deposit, earn, and compound yield directly on-chain using USDC

We’re actively expanding support to more assets within the Sui DeFi stack, we will announce when the new assets are launched including:

- **SUI**

- **Walrus**

- **xBTC**


Each new asset comes with its own vault templates and strategy modules, allowing agents to intelligently route capital based on market depth, yield opportunity, and risk profile.

> **\*\*Note:** Multi-asset basket optimization (USDC + SUI + Walrus + xBTC) is already live in internal testing. Public rollout is planned for the next month launch update.
