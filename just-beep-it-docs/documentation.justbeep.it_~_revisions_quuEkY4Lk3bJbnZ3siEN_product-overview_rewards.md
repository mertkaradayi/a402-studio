# Rewards

**Beeper Boost** program features three tiers based on collective protocol Assets under Agentic Yield management (AUAM) milestones. Once a tier's target is reached, all qualifying beepers receive enhanced points multipliers on their balance-based yield rewards. Start accruing daily and can be redeemed for in the future for community perks.

Beeper Points are a way to reward user participation in the Agentic Yield ecosystem. By engaging with the platform and utilizing its features, users accumulate points that reflect their contribution to and engagement with the platform.

For detailed information on **Agent Arena Beep Points rewards**, please refer to the [Beep Points Rewards Guide](https://documentation.justbeep.it/~/revisions/quuEkY4Lk3bJbnZ3siEN/product-overview/agent-trader/agent-trader-season-one-grand-prix-rewards)

#### [Direct link to heading](https://documentation.justbeep.it/~/revisions/quuEkY4Lk3bJbnZ3siEN/product-overview/rewards\#wallet-balances)    Wallet Balances

Maintaining funds in your Beep Wallets generates points based on:

- The amount of assets held

- The duration those assets remain in the wallet


This rewards users who contribute to the ecosystem's Assets under Agentic Yield management (AUAM).

### [Direct link to heading](https://documentation.justbeep.it/~/revisions/quuEkY4Lk3bJbnZ3siEN/product-overview/rewards\#points-calculation)    Points Calculation

Points are computed and credited to user balances once every 24 hours. The calculation process accounts for several factors to ensure fair and accurate distribution, including:

- Asset values converted to USD equivalents

- Time-weighted average balances across all deposits

- Deployment and engagement metrics within the protocol


Points are allocated based on each participant’s proportional share of the **computed assets under agent management (AUAM).**

The **computed AUAM** represents total platform liquidity, adjusted for pool-specific multipliers and referral contributions:

- Liquidity deployed to external protocols (e.g., Bluefin, SuiLend, Navi, Momentum) is first deducted from the vault’s total TVL, then reintroduced with its corresponding multiplier applied.


The final adjusted AUAM forms the basis for point allocation. Each day, a fixed number of points is distributed proportionally to participants according to their weighted share of the computed AUAM.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://documentation.justbeep.it/~/revisions/quuEkY4Lk3bJbnZ3siEN/product-overview/rewards\#referrals-1)    1\. Deposits start earning immediately. UI/UX to track progress in real-time on the dashboard launching shortly

#### [Direct link to heading](https://documentation.justbeep.it/~/revisions/quuEkY4Lk3bJbnZ3siEN/product-overview/rewards\#referrals-2)    2\. Referrals

Users can earn Beeper Points by referring new users to the platform. When you successfully refer someone who becomes an active user, you will earn bonus points based on the referred AUAM.

This referral system rewards users for helping grow the Beeper community while providing ongoing benefits based on the engagement level of those they bring to the platform.

Referral-related AUAM is also adjusted by its referral multiplier, increasing the computed AUAM and the effective share of referrers in the total computation.
