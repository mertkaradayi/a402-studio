# What is Beep?

[Beep](https://justbeep.it/) is the agentic finance protocol, powering agentic yields, agent payments (a402/x402), and talk-to-money AI that let agents transact, earn yield, and manage value autonomously.

The protocol provides a complete financial stack for agents, including agent payments (a402/x402) and agentic yield management.

The launch debuts the Agentic Yield system on Sui, which uses autonomous financial agents to scan, score, allocate, and auto-compound stablecoin yield, all settled with Sui-native USDC for sub-second, near-zero-fee microtransactions. The launch also introduces the a402 protocol for HTTP-402 (“Payment Required”) paywalls and developer SDKs for server-to-server micropayments server-to-server micropayments for sub-second, zero-fee microtransactions settled natively on Sui.

Beep is building the financial nervous system for billions of autonomous agents to transact seamlessly across the open internet.
